#Wine Inspired Tracking Site

###Description
This is a website for tracking the wines that you drink.  You create an account and upload wines along with your comments and the option of a photo of the wine.  Along with this, you can rate the wine out of 10.

###Instructions
Please create a login account by clicking the "sign up" button on the home page!  From there you can follow the prompts on what to do.  If (for some weird reason you already have a sign up) please click login, and fill in your details there and click "login".

###Plan to complete MVP
Create a user model with authorisation (unclear of manner).  Also going to create a posts model, where each post has a text, image, rating, etc.  Once those are created link them togehter and move onto stretch.


###Stretch Goals
* Include a table for wines and build a DB for them.
* Have recommendations based upon the wines that you are drinking come up
* Get average pricing on your favourite wines
* Include the ability to learn about wine too
* See what other users are drinking
* Be able to follow certain users(influencers)


###Technologies used
* Bootstrap for layout
* Paperclip for image uploading
* S3 for image storage (links with Paperclip)
