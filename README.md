#Wine Inspired Tracking Site

###Description
This is a website for tracking the wines that you drink.  You create an account and upload wines along with your comments and the option of a photo of the wine.  Along with this, you can rate the wine out of 10.

###Plan to complete MVP
Create a user model with authorisation (unclear of manner).  Also going to create a posts model, where each post has a text, image, rating, etc.  Once those are created link them togehter and move onto stretch.


###Stretch Goals
* Include a table for wines and build a DB for them.
* Have recommendations based upon the wines that you are drinking come up
* Get average pricing on your favourite wines
* Include the ability to learn about wine too
* See what other users are drinking
* Be able to follow certain users(influencers)
